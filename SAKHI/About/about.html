				<h1>About Sakhi</h1>
				<p>
					Sakhi is more than just a website—it is a movement dedicated to
					empowering women by providing them with the resources, support, and
					opportunities they need to build a better future. In today’s digital
					age, access to information and community support can make a huge
					difference in the lives of women. Sakhi ensures that every woman,
					regardless of her background, has a safe and reliable platform to seek
					guidance, find opportunities, and connect with like-minded
					individuals.

				<h2>Why Sakhi Matters</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					Despite advancements in society, women still face significant
					challenges in terms of education, employment, healthcare, and safety.
					Many remain unaware of the opportunities and support available to
					them. Sakhi bridges this gap by acting as a one-stop platform where
					women can access crucial information and take charge of their futures.
				</p>

				<p>
					By offering career guidance, health resources, government benefits,
					and a strong support system, Sakhi aims to foster independence,
					confidence, and self-reliance among women. Our mission is to ensure
					that every woman, no matter where she comes from, has the opportunity
					to grow, achieve her dreams, and build a life of dignity and respect.
